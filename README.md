- Basic knowledge of shell commands

# Intro

Join WeCloudData to complete a DevOps mini project! In this 3-part workshop series you will learn:

- How to work with cloud infrastructures like AWS VPC and EC2 instances with Terraform
- How to install and config Git, Python and Docker in the two EC2 instances with Ansible
- How to create a CI/CD pipeline that deploys your application automatically to the EC2 instances when thereâ€™s a new push/merge in the main branch of your Github

We will spend the three workshops together to complete this mini project. In each workshop, we are going to introduce a tool, and do a live demo of how it works and what can be done with it.

# DevOps Mini-Project (Part 1): IaC with Terraform

Terraform is developed by a company called HashiCorp in order to manage infrastructures.

- Unify the view of resources using infrastructure as code
- Support the modern data center(Iaas, Paas, SaaS)
- Expose a way for individuals and teams to safely and predictably change infrastructure
- Provide a workflow that is technology agnostic
- Manage anything with an API

The code can be found in the feature/Terraform branch

# DevOps Mini-Project (Part 2): Introduction to Ansible

Ansible is powerful IT administration tool which is easy to learn and use. It can

- Provision resources
- Manage large amount of VM to a cluster
- Delivery software to multiple node at same time
- Run management script on multiple target systems.

The code can be found in the feature/Ansible branch

# DevOps Mini-Project (Part 3): CI/CD with Github Action

CI/CD stands for continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment and it usually consists of 4 stages: code merge, test, build, deployment

Github Action is a tool to automate the CI/CD workflows of developers

- A free tool
- serverless
- easy to setup and manage
